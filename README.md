### Hi there, I'm Andrey Tabakov - Lead Software Engineer ðŸ‘‹

I have always been passionate about software engineering and creating solutions that make a difference. As a Lead Software Engineer, I apply my programming skills and knowledge in various sectors, such as finance, healthcare, government, social and gaming. Some of the projects that I have worked on include a web platform to assist oncologists in making decisions, and web applications for making interactive reports on car traffic for business dept. Now I participate in the development of an AI-based solution that allows for data-pipeline creation without coding. I am always updating my skills and learning new languages, techniques and technologies. I design robust and efficient architectures for high-load microservices, ensuring scalability, reliability and security.
